"""summarize — the machinery UNDER the summarizer metaprompt.

Split (the session's law, one level up):
  - metaprompt (sol_summary_meta.md): proposes a CANDIDATE summary (stub + axioms + obligation).
    Stochastic, untrusted.
  - GATE (discharge_*, below): the ROOT OF TRUST. Hand-written, deterministic. PROVES the
    obligation with z3 before a summary is ever registered. Never generated, never an LLM call.
    If it can't prove the obligation, the summary is REJECTED — no false proofs slip in.
  - REGISTRY: only obligation-discharged summaries.
  - apply_summary: deterministic source transform (next step).

The obligation clauses are: floor((a*s)/T) satisfies the Euclidean bracket, the zero case, floor
monotonicity, and (under no-overflow) product monotonicity.

MEASURED FINDING (2026-06-04): bounded z3 CANNOT be the sound gate here. Proving each clause is an
UNSAT query over bit-blasted multiply/divide, which hits an exponential wall: floor_bracket proves
in 0.1s @ 8-bit, 2.7s @ 12-bit, TIMES OUT @ 16-bit. A 12-bit certificate (operands < 4096) is
worthless for ~1e18 token amounts. z3 inherits the very nonlinear-UNSAT incapacity we are abstracting
away. So the division of labour is:
  - z3  = fast REFUTATION pre-filter (find counterexamples to UNSOUND axioms cheaply; SAT is fast)
  - LEAN = the sound ROOT OF TRUST that PROVES the universal claim, width-independent. The four
    clauses are Mathlib one-liners: Nat.div_add_mod (bracket), trivial (zero), Nat.div_le_div_right
    (floor-monotone), Nat.mul_le_mul_right (product-monotone). ADMISSION REQUIRES the Lean proof;
    z3 only screens. (Lean gate: TODO — the honest next piece.)
